# Microservice Addons for Netlify

CONFIDENTIAL: Early private beta for invited partners only

Thank you for working with us as we develop our new microservice addons platform! (Name subject to change. ;) )

With the goal of enabling "service discovery for the frontend," we're working on a platform where third parties can offer managed microservices as easy one-click installs for the hundreds of thousands of developers on our platform.  

We're already testing internally with a multi-instance version of our [GoTrue](https://github.com/netlify/gotrue) API (managed in Netlify as our Identity service), and we're now inviting a few partners to try it out and help us best meet the needs of your services and your users.

These docs are a work in progress as the platform evolves with your feedback. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us in [Slack](https://netlify.slack.com).
